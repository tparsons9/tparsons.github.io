## About Me 
Welcome to my academic profile! I am currently an Empirical Research Fellow at Northwestern University - Kellogg School of Management. I assist Prof. Ilya Morozov in research related to consumer-search, how consumers make choices in online markets, and dynamic heterogeneous product choice. I am also the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Corus.io, a geopolitical risk index that aims to quantify reliance and resilience between state actors. Formerly a Sales Engineer at Siemens, Case Researcher at UVA - Darden School of Business, and Research Assistant for Clemson University, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Virginia. 

## Research Interests
I am interested in the intersection of quantitative marketing and public policy, with a focus on econometric techniques. Particularly, my interests are in using marketing as a tool to boost health outcomes, clean-energy choices, and consumer welfare. A selection of my writings (including working papers and writing samples) are included in their respective pages. 

## Site 
On this academic profile, I include writing samples, which feature research ideas that I have yet to implement studies, working papers, and blog posts on my research journey. My CV is also included in a separate section. I welcome all comments and suggestions for current and future research!
