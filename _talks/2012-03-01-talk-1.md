Much of contemporary research on materialism is concerned with individual behavioral and
local environmental variables, ignoring the top-level societal and institutional influences. It has been suggested that materialism be studied at the macro, institutional level. One framework that has successfully applied an institutional level of analysis is the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. This research examines if the IAD can be used to investigate materialism by using measures of the dominant social paradigm (DSP) and individual values.
