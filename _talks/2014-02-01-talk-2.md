Industries are facing an unprecedented time as the largest generation in history is preparing to retire. This is forcing companies and industries alike to assess their capabilities in training a new workforce and retaining the accumulated knowledge of veteran employees. This research study was conducted in partnership with a Fortune 500 international company to understand the most effective way for regional branch entrepreneurs to encourage the transfer of knowledge from a seasoned employee to someone with little industry knowledge. Specifically, on-site ethnography, focus groups and depth interviews (with both seasoned and new employees) were conducted at our partner company to answer our research question. Findings revealed three overarching themes that are key for
transferring generational knowledge, all that involve the rebranding of the internal company structure: 1) promoting organic mentorship, 2) reframing training to employees, and 3) removing the stigmatization of retirement to allow for better succession planning.
