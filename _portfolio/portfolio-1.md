There is a limited understanding of how spatial distance affects the perception of health access in rural
communities. Partnering with a 3rd party service provider, we studied the impact of signalling trip time vs.
distance and default choice on the rural patientâ€™s utilization of local primary care physicians. We find that
signalling trip-time significantly improves healthcare utilization over distance signals. Similarly, we find that
prompting potential patients to fill out a patient information card significantly increases health utilization.
In our final study, we measure preventable hospitalizations in select counties where the 3rd party service
provider was active, finding significantly lower hospitalizations in these counties over a 3-year span.
